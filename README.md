## MAIN STEPS TO USE THIS

### HOW TO SEARCH

Users can use the corresponding `index.html` file to begin the search. The `index.html` file is connected with the corresponding `php` file which is now already loaded with `Elastic Search`. And the `search_.php` file will connect corresponding `onesinger.php`, for example, to fetch what users want to get.

## THE LEFT PROCEDURE

1. The results of vague search has not been loaded with smart `css` styles. Please some of you load a suitable `css` style for each `search_singer.php`, `search_song.php`, `search_album.php`.  
2. The visualizaiton work has not been loaded yet.
